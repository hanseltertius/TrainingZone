    <br>Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous <span style="font-style: italic">Lecture Clash</span> training: <br>Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: 
    <br>•	Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. 
    <br>•	Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). 
    <br>•	Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. 
    <br>•	Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: 
    <br>o	If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. 
    <br>o	Which one are you most on top of? 
    <br>o	Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? 
    <br>•	Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.
